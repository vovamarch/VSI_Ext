  Simple Python example
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example displays a slider on the screen, using Tk, that can be manipulated
to send an interrupt to the VM. The VM can then read the current position of
the slider.

1. On your computer, install the CoreIO module:
  * go to the coreio library directory and type `pip3 install .'

2. Create a VM to run your consumer program on.
  * in Settings | Custom vMMIO, add a port with the following settings:

    START       SIZE        IRQ         PORT
    <mmio-addr> 0x1000      <irq>       4300

3. Make sure your computer is connected to the VM's project VPN.

4. Find out the Services IP for the consumer VM. (Let's say it's 10.11.211.9)

5. On your computer, run `python3 slider-mmio.py 10.11.211.9:4300'.
  * a small window with a slider should show up on the screen.

6. Moving the slider will assert the IRQ you specified when creating the VM.
  * to clear the IRQ, your program can write <mmio-addr> with any value.

7. At any time, your program in the VM can read address <mmio-addr>+4 to find
   out the current slider position.
