  VSI-over-vMMIO
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This program feeds a WAV file into the VM. It's based on the ARM VSI specification.

1. Create & start a Raspberry Pi VM to run VSI model on.
  * a `lite' image is fine,
  * you will need to `apt-get install make gcc'.

2. Put this directory on the Raspberry Pi, then run `make'.
  * you should get a program called `vsi-waveio'.

3. Put your WAV file on the Raspberry Pi.

4. Create a VM to run the VSI consumer program on.
  * in Settings | Custom vMMIO, add a port with the following settings:

    START       SIZE        IRQ         PORT
    <mmio addr> 0x20000     <irq list>  4300

5. Start the consumer VM paused.

6. Find out the Services IP for the consumer VM. (Let's say it's 10.11.211.9)

7. In the Raspberry Pi VM, run `vsi-waveio 10.11.211.9:4300 test.wav'.
  * the program should print `[vsi-waveio] Ready.' when everything is right.

8. Unpause the consumer VM.

9. Wait for the results.
  * the vsi-waveio program shows MMIO accesses and also announces end of file.
